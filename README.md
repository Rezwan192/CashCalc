Group Members; Josh, Sabeet, Shankar, Rezwan 

### Summary
CashCalc provides users with a personal finance tracker. It consists of a get started page that allows users to enter their budget, income, and expenses information. This is then connected to a dashboard page that summarizes the inputted user data, including visualizations using graphs. In addition, there is a budget planning page where users can assign levels of need to their expenses, upon which the expenses will be displayed on a table based on the level of need chosen. The last page is a profile page where the user can view and update their personal information.

2. Budget Planning Page

d. after assigning needs to their expenses, expenses will show on the budget planning page in their respective need columns (necessary, medium, and unnecessary)

### Uncompleted Features
Remember me
* Ran out of time due to prioritizing functionality of more important parts of the site

Reset email
* Able to send the reset link Containing id to gmail but unable to create a form without logging in and change the password

Budget Planning
* Due to having too much trouble trying to correctly implement the add item button in BPCard, i moved the logic over to BudgetPlanning, and made 1 uniform button rather than 3 made for each column(see figma for the design differences)
* The next problem I ran into was displaying the expenses within each column based on need. I wasnâ€™t able to display it on the budgetplanning component and the only way I could was on the BPCard component 
* Due to this need is added on one component while being displayed through another component, and I couldnt figure out how to keep everything up to date with database changes  and by this point we had no more time so left the page as is. However logging out, refreshing the page, and logging back in shows the need correctly based on changes on the database during testing.

Dashboard
* The Linechart Income and the Piechart Spent divs dynamically render on every subsequent entry to update the graphs itself. However, the **Linechart Expenses** **does not** do this, and as well it does not update on a new login. It is unclear to me and my peers what the issue is and it's something I most likley will never understand
* Piechart id displayed incorrectly on tooltip where in the linecharts they use strings on the tooltip, piechart instead defaults to using the id assigned to the objects in the array and unsure how to resolve this issue
* There was not enough time to render the savings graph, as we had to devote more time to fixing bugs we encountered during development of our own components and trying to get redux to work properly in the frontend
* There could have been a more customized tooltip if more time to learn and understand
* when it came to the display of the x-axis, strings exceeding a certain length would get cut off/overlap and altering the padding on X-axis did not solve the issue

Get Started

* Editing and removing entries in GetStarted page, which would then update the database and state accordingly
* A lot of time was spent on fixing other errors on the page,  which reduced the time that was designated to implement this feature 
* Errors that were dealt with:
  * Database not updating after state was updated
  * Initially displayed entries not displaying database data and only displaying new entries 
  * Displayed entries not updating after new entries were submitted to the database
  * Total income and total expenses being undefined (was calculating before asynchronous fetching of data was complete)
