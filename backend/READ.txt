    I Changed the dependency of nodemon to nodemon dev(so i can see each change in every instance), so to run just type in 
the console "npm run dev". 

    Can ignore authentication folder, code works fine(auth.js saves to db, validate.js missing way to get hashed pass from db but 
comparison works)

    Unable to figure out how to retrieve data from mongoDB, however a schema file was made(super basic for the purpose of testing).
Routes were made via router in userRoutes.js, and path works as intended for displaying mongoDB data. userRoutes.js includes a similar 
function, but sorts by id but its not working and can't figure it out. the idea is to have it work properly, then fetch data via id.
more info in userRoutes.js

    URI for connecting to database is included as a comment in server.js, so make your .env and include to connect to db. however,
looking at the actual database requires an invitation so that is on todo list.

    Code is decently commented, but ask for any clarification!
