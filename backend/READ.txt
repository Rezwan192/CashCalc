    I Changed the dependency of nodemon to nodemon dev(so i can see each change in every instance), so to run just type in 
the console "npm run dev". 

    Can ignore authentication folder, code works fine(auth.js saves to db, validate.js missing way to get hashed pass from db but 
comparison works)

    userSchema created, userRouter created, saving to collecion on userData model works. only need to figure out how to fetch from db. 

    Code is decently commented, but ask for any clarification!
